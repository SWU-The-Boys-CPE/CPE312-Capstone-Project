## Why Archive?

The main documentation has been reorganized to follow these best practices:
- **Single source of truth** - One version of each document
- **Clear hierarchy** - Organized by reading phase and user role
- **Reduced redundancy** - No duplicate information
- **Professional structure** - Clean, navigable folder layout
- **Easy maintenance** - Fewer files to update
