KEY FINDINGS FROM EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
============================================

1. DATA QUALITY
   - All datasets have been successfully cleaned with high completeness (≥95%)
   - Minimal or no missing values after preprocessing
   - Duplicate records have been removed

2. TRAFFIC PATTERNS
   - Congestion index shows seasonal variations
   - Peak traffic periods can be identified for optimization
   - Multiple variables (speed, volume) show strong interdependencies

3. TEMPORAL CHARACTERISTICS
   - Clear time-series patterns with daily, weekly, and seasonal components
   - Monthly variations indicate seasonal factors affecting traffic
   - Quarterly patterns aligned with regional events and travel patterns

4. EXTERNAL FACTORS
   - Weather conditions show correlation with traffic metrics
   - Accident frequency correlates with congestion levels
   - Transit ridership patterns complement traffic analysis

5. READY FOR MODELING
   - Data quality sufficient for machine learning applications
   - Sufficient observations for training and validation
   - Feature engineering opportunities identified

NEXT STEPS
==========
1. Feature engineering (lag features, rolling averages, categorical encoding)
2. Predictive model development (LSTM, ARIMA, XGBoost)
3. Hotspot identification and spatial analysis
4. Route optimization algorithm implementation
5. Interactive dashboard development
