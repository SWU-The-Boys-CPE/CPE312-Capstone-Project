# Phase T1: Project Kickoff and Planning

## 📋 Overview

This folder contains the **project definition and planning documentation** for the CPE312 Data Science Capstone Project.

**Project Title:** Bangkok Traffic Congestion Index Prediction Using Time-Series Machine Learning

**Team:** The Boys (SWU CPE)

---

## 🎯 Project Scope

This project focuses specifically on **predicting Bangkok's daily Traffic Congestion Index (TCI)** using:
- Historical traffic congestion data (2019-2025)
- Weather features (temperature, humidity, precipitation)
- Machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression)

### What's IN Scope ✅
- Bangkok Traffic Congestion Index prediction
- Weather correlation analysis
- Temporal pattern analysis (day of week, month, holidays)
- ML model comparison and evaluation

### What's OUT of Scope ❌
- Accident pattern analysis
- Public transit optimization
- Road network/infrastructure analysis
- Real-time prediction system deployment
- Multi-city analysis

## 📖 Key Document: Project Definition

The main document `10Traffic-Transport-Capstone.md` includes:

### 1. Problem Definition
- Bangkok's congestion costs ~97 million THB daily
- Average congestion index: 38.88, Peak: 162.13
- Core question: Can we predict daily TCI using historical data and weather?

### 2. Research Questions
1. What are the daily, weekly, and seasonal patterns in Bangkok's TCI?
2. How do weather conditions correlate with congestion levels?
3. Which ML model provides the best prediction accuracy?
4. Which features are most predictive of congestion?

### 3. Objectives
1. Collect and clean traffic + weather data
2. Perform exploratory data analysis
3. Engineer predictive features
4. Train and compare ML models
5. Evaluate model performance

### 4. Data Sources
| Dataset | Records | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Bangkok Traffic Congestion Index | 1,682 | Daily TCI values (2019-2025) |
| Bangkok Weather Data | 1,682 | Temperature, humidity, precipitation |

### 5. SDG Alignment
- **SDG 11:** Sustainable Cities and Communities
- **SDG 13:** Climate Action

## 🔗 Next Phase

After completing T1 (Planning), proceed to:
- **T2:** Data Collection, Cleaning, and EDA → `../T2/`
- **T3:** Model Development, Analysis, and Evaluation → `../T3/`
