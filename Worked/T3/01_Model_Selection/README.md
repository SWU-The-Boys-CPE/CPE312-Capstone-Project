## 🎯 Model Selection Criteria

1. **Problem Fit:** Does the model suit time-series/tabular data?
2. **Interpretability:** Can we explain the predictions?
3. **Performance:** Expected accuracy based on literature
4. **Scalability:** Can it handle production data?
5. **Implementation:** Complexity and team expertise
