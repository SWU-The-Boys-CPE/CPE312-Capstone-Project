## 1. Research Questions and Hypotheses

### RQ1: Traffic Prediction Accuracy

**Research Question:** Can we predict traffic congestion levels 15-60 minutes in advance with 75-85% accuracy?

**Hypothesis H1:** Machine learning models (LSTM, XGBoost) will achieve R² > 0.75 on the test set.

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| R² | > 0.75 | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| RMSE | < 8.0 | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| MAPE | < 15% | ⬜ | ⬜ |

**Validation Status:** ⬜ Pending

### RQ2: Hotspot Identification

**Research Question:** What are the most congested areas and why?

**Hypothesis H2:** Central Bangkok (Silom, Sukhumvit) will show consistently higher congestion.

| Finding | Expected | Actual | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|
| Central highest | Yes | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| Vibhavadi Rangsit | High congestion | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| Suburban areas | Lower congestion | ⬜ | ⬜ |

**Validation Status:** ⬜ Pending

### RQ3: Weather-Traffic Relationship

**Research Question:** How do weather conditions affect traffic patterns?

**Hypothesis H3:** Rainfall increases congestion by 15-30%.

| Condition | Expected Effect | Actual | Status |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|--------|
| Heavy rain | +20-30% congestion | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| Light rain | +5-10% congestion | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| High temperature | +5-10% congestion | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| Poor visibility | +10-15% congestion | ⬜ | ⬜ |

| Category | Expected Rank | Actual Rank | Status |
|----------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Lag features | 1st | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| Temporal features | 2nd | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| Weather features | 3rd | ⬜ | ⬜ |
