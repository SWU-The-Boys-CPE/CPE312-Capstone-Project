Preparing the Dataset for Preprocessing and EDA
To begin this assignment, you will need to prepare the dataset that has been surveyed and collected from the previous week's problem and object of work. This dataset will be used for the Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process, which should be completed within 1-2 weeks.
Steps to Prepare the Dataset
1. Data Collection: Gather all the relevant data from the previous week's problem and object of work.
Ensure that the data is complete and accurate.
2. Data Cleaning: Review the collected data for any inconsistencies, missing values, or errors. Clean the data by addressing any issues found.
3. Data Organization: Organize the dataset in a structured manner, ensuring that it is ready for analysis.
This may involve arranging the data into appropriate columns, rows, and formats.
Preprocessing and EDA Process
Once the dataset is prepared, you will move on to the Preprocessing and EDA process. This involves the following steps:
1. Data Preprocessing: Prepare the data for analysis by handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables if necessary.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct a thorough exploration of the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships. This may involve visualizations, summary statistics, and correlation analysis.
3. In-depth Analysis: Dive deeper into the dataset to gain insights and identify potential areas for further investigation.
Timeline for Completion
It is important to manage your time effectively to ensure the completion of the Preprocessing and EDA process within 2-3 weeks. Here's a suggested timeline:
• Week1: Kickoff and Planning
• Week 2: Data collection, cleaning, and initial EDA
• Week 3: In-depth analysis and finalizing EDA findings
Remember to document your process and findings as you progress through the assignment. Good luck!
